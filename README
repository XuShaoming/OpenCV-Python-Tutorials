    This project includes the example codes and Exercise solutions I write for the book opencv-python-tutroals. 
    The code files are .ipynb type. To read and run these files your need to install python3, jupyter notebook, and opencv-python.
    
    To intall python3 : 
        https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/
    
    To instal jupyter notebook :
        http://jupyter.org/install
    
    There are ways to install opencv on windows and Linux in opencv-python-tutroals book.
    For mac user, we could follow these steps:
        1. install opencv on mac:

        2. create python virtual environment:
            1) Create : python3 -m venv tutorial-env
            2) Run    : source tutorial-env/bin/activate 
            3) Exit   : deactivate
        3.Use jupyter notebooks in the virtual environment
